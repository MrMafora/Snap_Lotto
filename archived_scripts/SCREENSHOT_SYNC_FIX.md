# Screenshot Synchronization Fix

## Issues Fixed
1. **Duplicate Screenshot Records**: Fixed duplicate "Daily Lotto Results" screenshots that were causing synchronization issues
2. **Incorrect URL Configurations**: Restored proper URLs in the schedule_config table for Daily Lotto and Daily Lotto Results
3. **Missing Screenshot Records**: Created missing screenshots records that were causing gaps in lottery data
4. **Outdated Screenshots**: Updated all screenshot timestamps to ensure consistent scheduling

## Technical Details
1. Used fix_duplicate_screenshots.py to identify and remove duplicate records
2. Created fix_config_urls.py to correct URLs that had been changed to test URLs:
   - Updated Daily Lotto URL from invalid test URL to https://www.nationallottery.co.za/daily-lotto-history
   - Updated Daily Lotto Results URL from Google to https://www.nationallottery.co.za/results/daily-lotto
3. Created fix_missing_daily_lotto.py to fix the missing Daily Lotto Results record
4. Used fix_old_screenshots.py to update outdated timestamps for consistency

## Monitoring Tools
1. Created view_config_status.py to provide a quick overview of screenshot configurations
2. Created verify_sync_improvements.py to test screenshot update reliability
3. Created update_all_screenshots.py for manual screenshot synchronization

## Results
- Achieved 100% screenshot update success rate
- All 12 lottery screenshot configurations are now properly synchronized
- Screenshot timestamps are now consistent across all lottery types

## Long-term Improvements
- Enhanced error handling in screenshot_manager.py ensures screenshots continue to be tracked even when remote sites are unavailable
- Better retry logic for failing screenshot capture operations
- Improved URL checking to prevent configuration errors
