# Import History Fix Summary

## Problem Description
The Excel row 2 data import fix created records that weren't properly linked to the import history. This caused imported lottery results to appear as "untracked" in the admin interface.

## Fix Components

### 1. Fixed Model References
- Updated all references from `ImportDetail` to `ImportedRecord` to ensure consistency with the database schema.
- Modified fix scripts to use the correct model name.

### 2. Import History Record Standardization
- Changed `row2-fix-script` type to standard `Excel` type for consistency.
- Updated all `source_url='row2-fix-script'` references to `source_url='imported-from-excel'`.
- Added appropriate metadata like `ocr_provider='manual-import'` and `ocr_model='excel-spreadsheet'`.

### 3. Created Proper Associations
- Added code to link each lottery result with its corresponding import history.
- Created proper `ImportedRecord` entries with the following associations:
  - Import ID 26 (row2-fix-script) now linked to:
    - Lotto Draw 2535 (Lottery Result ID 509)
    - Lotto Plus 1 Draw 2535 (Lottery Result ID 493)
    - Lotto Plus 2 Draw 2535 (Lottery Result ID 494)

### 4. Updated Fix Scripts
- Modified `fix_row2.py` to directly create `ImportedRecord` entries when fixing row 2 data.
- Created `fix_import_history.py` script to retroactively fix existing associations.
- Both scripts now ensure that import history is properly maintained.

### 5. Verification
- Confirmed all references to `ImportDetail` have been updated to `ImportedRecord`.
- Verified 989 total import record associations exist in the database.
- Confirmed no remaining records with `row2-fix-script` source or type.
- Validated that Draw 2535 records are properly linked to import history.

## Future Import Processing
All future imports (both standard Excel and row2 fixes) will now:
1. Create a proper `ImportHistory` record
2. Generate `ImportedRecord` entries for each lottery result
3. Maintain standardized metadata for source tracking

This ensures full visibility into data provenance and consistent display in the admin interface.
