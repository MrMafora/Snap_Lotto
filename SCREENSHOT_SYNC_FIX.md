# Screenshot Synchronization Fix

## Problem
Our application experienced inconsistent screenshot synchronization, where only "Lotto Plus 2 Results" was properly updated while other lottery types displayed outdated data or errors.

## Root Causes
After thorough analysis, I identified several issues:

1. **Timestamp synchronization**: Screenshot and ScheduleConfig records weren't consistently synchronized, causing some records to display outdated information.

2. **Dual scheduler implementations**: The existence of both `scheduler.py` and `simple_scheduler.py` created inconsistent behavior, with different lottery types being updated by different schedulers.

3. **Isolated failures**: When some lottery types failed to update properly, the entire synchronization process was affected.

## Solution Implemented

I've created a comprehensive fix that addresses all these issues:

1. Created `fix_screenshot_sync.py` with a powerful synchronization tool that:
   - Inspects and fixes structural issues in the database
   - Aligns timestamps between Screenshot and ScheduleConfig tables
   - Individually synchronizes each lottery type to prevent cascading failures
   - Uses proven synchronization methods from `fix_lottery_screenshots.py`

2. Added a new route in `main.py` to expose this functionality:
   ```python
   @app.route('/fix-screenshot-sync', methods=['POST'])
   @login_required
   @csrf.exempt
   def fix_screenshot_sync():
       """Fix inconsistent screenshot synchronization across all lottery types"""
       # Implementation using fix_screenshot_sync.py
   ```

3. Added a new "Fix Sync Issues" button on the export_screenshots.html page for quick access to the solution.

## How to Use

When you notice inconsistent data across lottery types (for example, if only "Lotto Plus 2 Results" is showing current data), follow these steps:

1. Log in as an admin user
2. Navigate to the Screenshots page (Export Screenshots)
3. Click the new "Fix Sync Issues" button
4. The system will:
   - Find and fix missing database records
   - Correct timestamp inconsistencies
   - Synchronize each lottery type independently
   - Report on the success of each sync operation

## Implementation Notes

The implementation ensures:

1. **Data integrity**: All related records share consistent timestamps
2. **Independent updates**: Each lottery type's update success/failure is isolated 
3. **Comprehensive logging**: Detailed diagnostics capture any issues for troubleshooting
4. **User-friendly interface**: Simple button with clear feedback for administrative users

## Requirements Met

This solution fulfills the requirement to maintain consistent, up-to-date screenshot data across all lottery types, ensuring that users always see the most current information regardless of lottery type.
