- **Backend**: Python Flask framework.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with optimized architecture including 4 performance indexes, cleaned duplicate tables, and major space savings.
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini 2.5 Pro for AI-powered ticket scanning and data extraction. This involves a comprehensive AI processor (`ai_lottery_processor.py`) that handles full prize division extraction, number recognition, and confidence scoring.
- **Automation Workflow**: A robust 4-step automation process using Playwright + Chromium for screenshot capture, AI processing, database updates, and frontend verification. This includes anti-detection stealth measures and proper browser headers for reliable data fetching.
- **Data Handling**: Strict adherence to authentic data only. Duplicate prevention system implemented to maintain database integrity. PostgreSQL array parsing is used for bonus numbers.
- **Security**: Implemented CSRF protection, comprehensive form validation, secure session settings, rate limiting, input sanitization, and centralized error handling.
- **Performance**: Optimized database queries, critical performance indexes, and a cache manager for speed improvements. Decoupled card heights for optimal content display and layout optimization.

    - **Ticket Scanner**: Extracts player-selected numbers and detects multiple game types (LOTTO, LOTTO PLUS 1, LOTTO PLUS 2) with multi-line support.
    - **Results Display**: Shows complete lottery results with all prize divisions (8 for Lotto, 9 for Powerball, 4 for Daily Lotto) and financial details. Numbers are sorted in ascending order.
    - **Data Analytics**: Displays hot/cold/absent numbers and frequency charts, all derived from authentic lottery data.
    - **Automated Scheduler**: Daily scheduler system running at 10:30 PM SA time to automatically run the complete 4-step automation process.
    - **Data Preview and Approval System**: Allows review, approval, deeper extraction requests, and rejection of AI-extracted data.
