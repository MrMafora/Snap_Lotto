# Project Cleanup Summary

## Actions Taken

1. **Identified Essential Files:** Created a list of essential files that are actually needed for the application to run.

2. **Archived Unnecessary Files:** Moved 100+ unnecessary scripts and one-off fixes to the `archived_scripts` folder with a manifest file for reference.

3. **Fixed Logger Dependencies:** Updated `scheduler.py` and `screenshot_manager.py` to use the standard Python logging module instead of the separate `logger.py` module.

4. **Recreated Workflow Configuration:** Created a proper workflow configuration for the main application to ensure it starts correctly.

## Current Project Structure

The project now consists of the following essential components:

- **main.py**: Core application file with routes and controllers
- **models.py**: Database models with SQLAlchemy
- **config.py**: Application configuration
- **scheduler.py**: Handles scheduled tasks
- **screenshot_manager.py**: Manages screenshot capture
- **health_monitor.py**: Monitors application health
- **automated_lottery_extraction.py**: Extracts lottery data
- **lottery_analysis.py**: Analyzes lottery data
- **ad_management.py**: Manages advertisements

## Known Issues

1. **Screenshot Manager Dependencies**: The screenshot manager still shows errors for missing Playwright dependencies. These should be installed if screenshot functionality is needed.

2. **Scheduler Module Dependencies**: The scheduler module has dependencies on OCR processor and data aggregator that may need to be restored.

## Next Steps

1. **Install Required Packages**: Use the package manager to install any missing dependencies like Playwright.

2. **Test the Application**: Ensure the application runs correctly after the cleanup.

3. **Update Documentation**: Update any documentation that referenced the removed files.

4. **Optimize Database Configuration**: Review and optimize database connection settings.

## How to Restore Archived Files

If you need to restore any file from the archive, you can find it in the `archived_scripts` folder. The archive manifest (timestamped) in that folder lists all the files that were moved and their original locations.
