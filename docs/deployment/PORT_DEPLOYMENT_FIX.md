# Port Configuration Fix for Replit Deployment

## Issue
The deployment was failing with the following errors:
- Port mismatch between deployment configuration and run command
- The server was binding to port 5000 in run command but needs to be on port 8080 for GCE deployments
- Configuration in .replit and replit_deployment.toml were inconsistent

## Changes Made

1. Created/updated `.replit-deployment` file:
   ```
   deploymentTarget = "gce"
   run = ["sh", "-c", "gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8080 main:app"]
   build = ["sh", "-c", "pip install -r requirements.txt"]
   ```

2. Verified `replit_deployment.toml` is correctly configured:
   ```
   run = "gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8080 main:app"
   deploymentTarget = "gce"
   ```

3. Confirmed `gunicorn.conf.py` is environment-aware:
   ```python
   # Determine binding based on environment
   environment = os.environ.get('ENVIRONMENT', 'development')
   
   # Primary binding
   if environment.lower() == 'production':
       # Production environment uses port 8080 for Replit deployment
       bind = "0.0.0.0:8080"
   else:
       # Development environment uses port 5000
       bind = "0.0.0.0:5000"
   ```

4. Confirmed port forwarding configuration in `.replit-ports`:
   ```
   [[ports]]
   localPort = 8080
   externalPort = 80
   ```

## Deployment Strategy
- **Development Mode**: Uses port 5000 for local development and testing
- **Production Mode**: Uses port 8080 for Replit GCE deployment
- The application automatically detects the environment and binds to the appropriate port

This configuration ensures that:
1. Development workflow continues to work using port 5000
2. Deployment to Replit uses the required port 8080
3. Port forwarding is correctly configured for external access
