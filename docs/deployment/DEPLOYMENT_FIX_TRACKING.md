# Deployment Fix Tracking

## Port Configuration Fixes
- [x] 2025-04-16: Updated gunicorn.conf.py to handle both development (5000) and production (8080) ports
- [x] 2025-04-16: Configured replit_deployment.toml for port 8080
- [x] 2025-04-16: Created Production workflow for port 8080

## Workflow Configurations
- [x] 2025-04-16: Development workflow set to port 5000
- [x] 2025-04-16: Production workflow set to port 8080

## Future Considerations
1. Maintain consolidated port configurations:
   - Development: Port 5000 (gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000)
   - Production: Port 8080 (gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8080)
   - Health checks: Root path "/"
   
2. Deployment configuration standards:
   - Use GCE deployment target
   - Maintain environment-specific settings
   - Keep port forwarding rules consistent
   - Update this tracking file for all changes

## Latest Consolidation (2024-04-16)
- [x] Unified port configuration across all files
- [x] Standardized health check path
- [x] Environment-aware gunicorn configuration
- [x] Proper port forwarding setup
