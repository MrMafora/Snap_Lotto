# Project Cleanup Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the cleanup efforts performed on the Lottery Data Intelligence Platform project to improve organization and maintainability.

## Cleanup Date

April 15, 2025

## Files Organized

### Port Binding Experiments

The following port binding experimental files were moved to `backup_deployments/port_binding_experiments/`:

* absolute_minimal.py
* absolute_minimal_8080.py
* direct_port_8080.py
* dual_port_app.py
* port_8080_*.py files
* port_binding_solution.py
* replit_port_8080.py
* run_port_8080.py
* simple_8080_server.py
* standalone_port_8080.py
* minimal_http_server.py
* workflow_dual_port_starter.py

### Old Scripts

The following redundant script files were moved to `backup_deployments/old_scripts/`:

* maintain_port_8080.py
* move_redundant_scripts.sh
* update_port_binding.sh
* workflow_wrapper.sh
* examine_excel.py
* test_division_extraction.py
* test_divisions.py
* test_fetch.py

## Key Documentation Preserved

The following documentation files were preserved in the main directory:

* PORT_BINDING_SOLUTION.md - Documents the approach used to handle Replit's port binding requirements
* FINAL_PORT_SOLUTION.md - Documents the final solution implemented for port binding
* final_port_solution.sh - Shell script implementing the final port solution for direct execution

## Core Files Retained

The following core files were retained in the main directory:

* main.py - Main application entry point
* models.py - Database models
* config.py - Application configuration
* data_aggregator.py - Data processing logic
* scheduler.py - Task scheduler
* ocr_processor.py - OCR processing logic
* ticket_scanner.py - Lottery ticket scanning functionality
* screenshot_manager.py - Screenshot capture and management
* gunicorn.conf.py - Gunicorn WSGI server configuration
* import_excel.py - Excel data import functionality
* import_snap_lotto_data.py - Specific lottery data import script
* fix_daily_lotto_bonus.py - Data correction script
* launch.sh - Application launch script
* organize_assets.sh - Asset organization script

## Log Files & Temporary Files

All log files and temporary files were moved to appropriate backup directories to keep the main directory clean.

## Configuration Files

The following configuration files were organized:

* `requirements.txt.bak` - Moved to backup_deployments/config_backups/
* Redundant configuration files related to port binding experiments were moved to appropriate backup directories

## Final Project Structure

The final project structure is clean and organized with:

1. Core application Python files in the root directory
2. Documentation files (.md) with relevant information preserved
3. Essential shell scripts for launching and maintaining the application
4. All redundant experiments and files properly archived in backup_deployments

## Port Binding Solution

We've identified that despite our multiple approaches to solve the port binding issue (port 8080 for Replit external access), the web server still shows as unreachable in Replit's feedback tool. 

Our main approaches included:
1. A lightweight HTTP server on port 8080 that redirects to port 5000
2. Modifying main.py to listen on port 8080 when run directly
3. Using the `final_port_solution.sh` script that runs both servers simultaneously

These solutions continue to be maintained in the project, and we've preserved all documentation about the port binding approaches in PORT_BINDING_SOLUTION.md and FINAL_PORT_SOLUTION.md.

## Conclusion

This cleanup ensures the project is more maintainable and easier to navigate. The core functionality remains intact while redundant files have been properly archived.
