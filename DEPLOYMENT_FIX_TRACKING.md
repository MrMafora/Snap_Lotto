# Deployment Fix Tracking

## Port Configuration Fixes
- [x] 2025-04-16: Updated gunicorn.conf.py to handle both development (5000) and production (8080) ports
- [x] 2025-04-16: Configured replit_deployment.toml for port 8080
- [x] 2025-04-16: Created Production workflow for port 8080

## Workflow Configurations
- [x] 2025-04-16: Development workflow set to port 5000
- [x] 2025-04-16: Production workflow set to port 8080

## Future Considerations
1. Avoid modifying existing port configurations in:
   - gunicorn.conf.py
   - replit_deployment.toml
   - .replit
   
2. For any new port-related changes:
   - Development should use port 5000
   - Production should use port 8080
   - Update this tracking file before implementing changes
