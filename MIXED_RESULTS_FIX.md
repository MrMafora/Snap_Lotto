# Mixed Game Results Fix

This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve the issue where mixed game results (e.g., Powerball and Lotto) were appearing together when scanning different tickets sequentially.

## Issue

When scanning different types of lottery tickets in sequence (e.g., a Powerball ticket followed by a Lotto ticket), results from previous scans were not properly cleared, causing confusing mixed results to be displayed.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Frontend Improvements

#### Enhanced `clearPreviousResults()` Function
- Added comprehensive clearing for all game-specific containers
- Added proper handling for all additional game containers (Powerball Plus, Lotto Plus 1, Lotto Plus 2)
- Added clearing of matched numbers counts and content

```javascript
// Hide and clear all additional game containers
const additionalGameContainers = [
    'powerball-plus-numbers-container',
    'lotto-plus-1-numbers-container',
    'lotto-plus-2-numbers-container'
];

additionalGameContainers.forEach(id => {
    const container = document.getElementById(id);
    if (container) {
        container.classList.add('d-none');
        
        // Also clear the numbers inside these containers
        const numbersEl = document.getElementById(id.replace('-container', ''));
        if (numbersEl) {
            numbersEl.innerHTML = '';
        }
        
        // Clear the matched numbers
        const matchedId = id.replace('numbers-container', 'matched-numbers');
        const matchedEl = document.getElementById(matchedId);
        if (matchedEl) {
            matchedEl.innerHTML = '';
        }
        
        // Reset the matched count
        const countId = id.replace('numbers-container', 'matched-count');
        const countEl = document.getElementById(countId);
        if (countEl) {
            countEl.textContent = '0';
        }
    }
});
```

#### Conditional Display Logic
- Modified display logic to only show additional game results when appropriate
- Added game type checking to ensure Powerball Plus only displays with Powerball tickets
- Added game type checking to ensure Lotto Plus 1/2 only display with Lotto tickets

```javascript
// Make sure we only show the Powerball Plus section if this ticket plays Powerball Plus
if (data.lottery_type === "Powerball" && data.powerball_plus_results) {
    // Powerball Plus results display logic
}

// Handle Lotto Plus 1 numbers if present - but only if the main game is Lotto
if (data.lottery_type === "Lotto" && data.lotto_plus_1_results) {
    // Lotto Plus 1 results display logic
}

// Handle Lotto Plus 2 numbers if present - but only if the main game is Lotto
if (data.lottery_type === "Lotto" && data.lotto_plus_2_results) {
    // Lotto Plus 2 results display logic
}
```

### 2. Backend Improvements

#### Enhanced Game Type Detection

We modified the `ticket_scanner.py` file to add explicit lottery type checking when determining which additional games to include:

```python
# Check for Powerball Plus if applicable
# Only check if primary game is Powerball and ticket plays Powerball Plus
if lottery_type == "Powerball" and plays_powerball_plus:
    logger.info("This ticket also plays Powerball Plus - checking both games")
    powerball_plus_result = get_lottery_result("Powerball Plus", draw_number)
elif lottery_type == "Powerball":
    logger.info("This ticket is Powerball only - NOT checking Powerball Plus")

# Check for Lotto Plus 1 if applicable
# Only check if primary game is Lotto and ticket plays Lotto Plus 1
if lottery_type == "Lotto" and plays_lotto_plus_1:
    logger.info("This ticket also plays Lotto Plus 1 - checking both games")
    lotto_plus_1_result = get_lottery_result("Lotto Plus 1", draw_number)
elif lottery_type == "Lotto":
    logger.info("This ticket doesn't play Lotto Plus 1 or it wasn't detected")

# Check for Lotto Plus 2 if applicable
# Only check if primary game is Lotto and ticket plays Lotto Plus 2
if lottery_type == "Lotto" and plays_lotto_plus_2:
    logger.info("This ticket also plays Lotto Plus 2 - checking both games")
    lotto_plus_2_result = get_lottery_result("Lotto Plus 2", draw_number)
elif lottery_type == "Lotto":
    logger.info("This ticket doesn't play Lotto Plus 2 or it wasn't detected")
```

## Benefits

These changes ensure:

1. Clean slate for each new ticket scan
2. No mixing of different game type results
3. Proper game-specific behavior (e.g., only showing Powerball Plus with Powerball tickets)
4. Improved user experience with less confusion

## Testing

The application was tested with sequential scanning of different ticket types to verify that each scan shows only the appropriate game results.
