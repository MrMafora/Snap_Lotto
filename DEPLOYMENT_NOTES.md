# Deployment Notes for Lottery Data Intelligence Platform

## Current Status

As of April 15, 2025, the Lottery Data Intelligence Platform has been successfully deployed on Replit with the following configuration:

- **Primary Access Port**: 5000 (internal Replit access)
- **External Access Port**: 8080 (required by Replit for external access)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (provided by Replit)
- **Web Server**: Gunicorn

## Application Features

The application provides the following core functionalities:

1. Lottery results collection and display
2. Ticket scanning for checking winning numbers
3. Data visualization for number frequency analysis
4. Administrative interface for managing data collection
5. Scheduled tasks for automatic data updates

## Access Points

- **Admin Dashboard**: /admin (requires login)
- **Results Overview**: /results
- **Ticket Scanner**: /ticket-scanner
- **API Endpoints**: /api/results/{lottery_type}

## Port Binding Solution

Despite multiple attempts to enable port 8080 for external access, the application currently shows as "Web server is unreachable" when accessed through Replit's external URL. The application is confirmed to be working correctly on port 5000 within Replit's environment.

We have attempted multiple solutions:

1. A lightweight HTTP server on port 8080 that redirects to port 5000
2. Modifying main.py to listen on port 8080 when run directly
3. Using the final_port_solution.sh script that runs both servers simultaneously

## Deployment Next Steps

For full external deployment, the following steps may be taken:

1. Deploy using Replit's deployment feature, which may resolve the port binding issue automatically
2. Consider using a custom domain if available
3. Ensure all environment variables are properly set up in the deployment environment
4. Monitor the application logs for any errors or performance issues

## Authentication

Admin access requires authentication with the following credentials:
- **Username**: admin
- **Password**: St0n3@g3

## Notes on OCR Functionality

The ticket scanning feature requires the Anthropic API key to be set as the environment variable `Lotto_scape_ANTHROPIC_KEY`. Ensure this is properly configured in the deployment environment for OCR functionality to work correctly.
