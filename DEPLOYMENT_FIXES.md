# Cloud Run Deployment Fixes Applied

This document outlines all the fixes applied to resolve the deployment issues.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Port Configuration for Cloud Run
**Problem**: Application was binding to port 8080 in deployment config but Cloud Run expects dynamic PORT environment variable.

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Updated `main.py` to use `PORT` environment variable with fallback to 5000 for local development
- ✅ Updated `replit_deployment.toml` to use `$PORT` environment variable in gunicorn command
- ✅ Created `Dockerfile` with proper Cloud Run port handling

### 2. Package Installation Issues
**Problem**: pyee package installation failing due to existing installation without record file.

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Created `deploy.sh` script that handles package conflicts by forcing reinstall
- ✅ Added package verification and automatic fixing in deployment script
- ✅ Configured proper dependency management for Cloud Run

### 3. Deployment Configuration
**Problem**: Missing proper Cloud Run deployment configuration.

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Created `Dockerfile` optimized for Cloud Run with proper security and performance settings
- ✅ Created `cloudbuild.yaml` for automated Google Cloud Build deployment
- ✅ Updated `replit_deployment.toml` to remove fixed port constraints
- ✅ Added proper environment variable configuration

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified Files:
- `main.py`: Added PORT environment variable support
- `replit_deployment.toml`: Updated for Cloud Run compatibility

### New Files Created:
- `Dockerfile`: Production-ready container configuration
- `deploy.sh`: Deployment preparation script
- `cloudbuild.yaml`: Cloud Build automation configuration
- `DEPLOYMENT_FIXES.md`: This documentation

## Deployment Commands

### For Replit Deployments:
The application now automatically uses the correct port configuration.

### For Manual Cloud Run Deployment:
```bash
# Run deployment preparation
./deploy.sh

# Deploy using gcloud CLI
gcloud run deploy lottery-scanner --source . --port 8080 --region us-central1
```

### For Automated Cloud Build Deployment:
```bash
gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild.yaml
```

## Configuration Changes Summary

1. **Port Binding**: Now uses `PORT` environment variable (defaults to 5000 locally, uses Cloud Run's PORT in production)
2. **Package Management**: Automated handling of package conflicts
3. **Production Settings**: Optimized gunicorn configuration for Cloud Run
4. **Container Security**: Non-root user and proper permissions
5. **Build Optimization**: Multi-stage build for smaller images

## Testing the Fixes

The application should now:
- ✅ Start successfully on any port specified by the `PORT` environment variable
- ✅ Handle package installation issues automatically
- ✅ Deploy successfully to Cloud Run without port conflicts
- ✅ Maintain all existing functionality while being Cloud Run compatible

All changes maintain backward compatibility with the existing Replit environment while adding Cloud Run deployment support.
