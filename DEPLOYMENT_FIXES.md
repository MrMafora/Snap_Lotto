# Cloud Run Deployment Fixes Applied

## Summary
All deployment issues have been successfully resolved to ensure compatibility with Google Cloud Run.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ pyee Package Installation Issue
- **Problem**: Corrupted pyee package installation without RECORD file
- **Solution**: 
  - Force reinstalled pyee package (version 12.1.1)
  - Added specific version pinning to prevent conflicts
  - Updated deployment script to handle package corruption

### 2. ✅ Port Configuration Mismatch
- **Problem**: Application was binding to fixed port 8080 instead of using dynamic PORT environment variable
- **Solutions Applied**:
  - Updated `gunicorn.conf.py` to use `os.environ.get('PORT', 5000)`
  - Modified `replit_deployment.toml` to use `${PORT:-8080}` with fallback
  - Updated `main.py` to use PORT environment variable (already implemented)
  - Updated `app.py` to use PORT environment variable with proper import

### 3. ✅ Gunicorn Command Execution
- **Problem**: Gunicorn couldn't start due to fixed port binding
- **Solutions Applied**:
  - Updated gunicorn configuration to dynamically bind to Cloud Run's PORT
  - Created deployment script that tests gunicorn configuration
  - Added proper error handling and fallbacks

### 4. ✅ Environment Variable Configuration
- **Solutions Applied**:
  - Added comprehensive environment variable setup in deployment script
  - Configured PORT, FLASK_ENV, PYTHONUNBUFFERED, DATABASE_URL, SESSION_SECRET
  - Added proper fallbacks for local development vs Cloud Run deployment

### 5. ✅ Deployment Configuration Updates
- **Files Updated**:
  - `gunicorn.conf.py`: Dynamic port binding
  - `replit_deployment.toml`: Shell command with PORT variable
  - `app.py`: Added os import and PORT environment variable usage
  - `main.py`: Already had correct PORT configuration
  - `deploy.sh`: Comprehensive deployment preparation script
  - `Dockerfile`: Added for containerized deployment option

## Verification

### Test Results
- ✅ pyee package properly installed (version 12.1.1)
- ✅ Application imports successfully with PORT=8080
- ✅ Gunicorn configuration test passes
- ✅ Environment variables properly configured
- ✅ Database connection verified
- ✅ Dynamic port binding functional

### Files Modified
1. `gunicorn.conf.py` - Dynamic port binding
2. `replit_deployment.toml` - Shell command with PORT variable
3. `app.py` - Added os import and PORT usage
4. `deploy.sh` - Enhanced deployment script
5. `Dockerfile` - Added Cloud Run optimized container

### New Files Created
1. `Dockerfile` - Container configuration for Cloud Run
2. `DEPLOYMENT_FIXES.md` - This documentation

## Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Direct Deployment (Replit)
The application is now configured to automatically use the PORT environment variable provided by Cloud Run.

### Option 2: Container Deployment
Use the provided Dockerfile for containerized deployment:
```bash
docker build -t lottery-scanner .
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e PORT=8080 lottery-scanner
```

### Option 3: Manual Preparation
Run the deployment script before deployment:
```bash
./deploy.sh
```

## Key Features
- ✅ Dynamic port binding compatible with Cloud Run
- ✅ Automatic package conflict resolution
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Environment variable management
- ✅ Health checks and verification
- ✅ Production-ready configuration

## Next Steps
The application is now ready for Cloud Run deployment. All identified issues have been resolved and the deployment configuration is fully compatible with Google Cloud Run requirements.
