# Final Port Binding Solution for Replit Deployment

## Problem
When deploying a Flask application on Replit, we need to handle two port binding scenarios:

1. Internal port 5000 for the Flask application (traditional Flask port)
2. External port 8080 for Replit's WebView preview

## Solution Overview
We've implemented a dual port binding solution to handle requests on both ports:

1. The main Flask application runs on port 5000 using Gunicorn
2. A separate HTTP server runs on port 8080 to redirect all traffic to port 5000

## Implementation Files

### 1. run_port_8080_bridge.py
This script runs a simple HTTP server on port 8080 that redirects all traffic to port 5000.

### 2. dual_port_binding.py
A comprehensive script that starts both the port 8080 bridge and the main Flask application in a single process.

### 3. start_app.sh
A bash script that launches both services together.

## Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Use the Workflow Configuration
Update the Replit workflow configuration to run the dual_port_binding.py script:

```
python dual_port_binding.py
```

### Option 2: Use the Bash Script
Update the Replit workflow configuration to run the start_app.sh script:

```
bash start_app.sh
```

## Verification
After deploying, verify that:

1. The application is accessible via the Replit WebView preview (port 8080)
2. All features including admin pages like /import-data work correctly

## Notes
- This solution ensures compatibility with Replit's external access requirements
- Both HTTP and HTTPS traffic are properly handled
- The redirects are transparent to the end-user
- No code changes are needed in the Flask application itself
