# Final Port Solution for Replit Deployment

## The Challenge

Replit requires applications to bind to port 8080 to be accessible externally, while our application uses Gunicorn to serve on port 5000 for optimal performance and reliability.

## Solution Overview

We've implemented a multi-faceted approach to ensure our application is accessible both internally (port 5000) and externally (port 8080):

1. **Workflow Setup**: The main application runs on port 5000 using Gunicorn for production-grade performance
2. **Port 8080 Handler**: A separate lightweight HTTP server runs on port 8080 that redirects all traffic to port 5000
3. **Direct Access**: The main application is configured to start directly on port 8080 when run outside of Gunicorn

## Implementation Details

### 1. Main Application (Port 5000)

- Uses Gunicorn for production-ready performance
- Configured for optimal worker management and connection handling
- Maintains database connections efficiently

### 2. Port 8080 Redirector

- Lightweight HTTP server that binds to port 8080
- Redirects all incoming requests to the corresponding paths on port 5000
- Minimal resource usage to avoid impacting application performance

### 3. Direct Port 8080 Binding

- When running the application directly (not through Gunicorn), it binds to port 8080
- This ensures compatibility with Replit's requirements for external access
- Modified main.py to always use port 8080 when run directly

## Technical Specifications

- Both port bindings use `0.0.0.0` to ensure accessibility from all network interfaces
- HTTP redirects preserve URL paths to maintain application functionality
- Error handling ensures that binding failures don't crash the application

## Testing and Verification

The solution has been tested using:
- Direct curl requests to both ports
- Replit's web application feedback tool
- Browser access through Replit's interface
