The Latest Results card is now correctly ordered with Lottery, Lottery Plus 1, Lottery Plus 2, Powerball, Powerball Plus, and Daily Lottery in the appropriate sequence.
However, the Data Analytics Preview section still has an issue - it's showing "Powerball" selected in the filter, but when you change this filter, the graph data and the hot/cold numbers are not updating to reflect the selected lottery type.

I'll rewrite a prompt to address this specific remaining issue:
"The Latest Results card order has been successfully fixed, but we still have a critical issue with the Data Analytics Preview section. When users change the lottery type filter (currently showing 'Powerball'), neither the graph data nor the hot/cold number displays are updating to reflect the selected game.
Please:

First, thoroughly examine the existing filter handling code in the Data Analytics Preview section - do NOT create new code without understanding the current implementation
Identify exactly why the data isn't refreshing when filters change:

Check if the filter events are properly triggering data refresh functions
Verify if the API calls to fetch new data for different lottery types are working
Examine if there's a caching issue preventing new data from being displayed
Check browser console for any JavaScript errors when filter changes occur


Fix both the graph and hot/cold numbers components to properly respond to filter changes:

Ensure both components are subscribed to the same filter change events
Verify the data transformation logic correctly processes different lottery types
Implement proper state management to ensure consistent updates across all components


Add proper loading indicators during data refresh to improve user experience
Test thoroughly with every lottery type to ensure consistent behavior
Document the specific issue and solution implemented

This is an important data visualization feature - users expect to see both the graph AND the hot/cold numbers change when selecting different lottery types. Currently, the filter appears to be purely decorative since it doesn't affect the displayed data
