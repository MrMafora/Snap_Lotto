Here's a comprehensive prompt that will help extract lottery results data accurately via the Claude Opus 4 API:
You are tasked with extracting lottery results data from images. Follow these precise instructions:

## Visual Cues to Use:
1. **Row Colors**: The table rows alternate between grey and white backgrounds. Use this pattern to ensure you're reading the correct row.
2. **Red DIV Numbers**: Division numbers (DIV 1, DIV 2, etc.) are displayed in red, helping you track which row you're on.
3. **Column Alignment**: Carefully match each value to its correct column - do not shift values up or down rows.

## Data to Extract:

### 1. Header Information:
- Lottery Type (LOTTO, LOTTO PLUS 1, LOTTO PLUS 2, POWERBALL, POWERBALL PLUS, DAILY LOTTO)
- Draw ID number
- Draw Date

### 2. Winning Numbers:
- Main numbers (displayed as individual balls)
- Bonus/Powerball number (displayed with a + sign)
- Numerical order (the sorted version of the numbers)

### 3. Prize Division Table:
For each division row, extract:
- Division number (DIV 1, DIV 2, etc.)
- Number of winners (from WINNERS column)
- Prize amount per winner (from WINNINGS column)

**CRITICAL**: Read each row carefully. The winner count for each division must come from the WINNERS column on the SAME row as that division number. Do not shift values between rows.

### 4. Additional Information (if visible):
- Rollover Amount
- Rollover Number
- Total Pool Size
- Total Sales
- Next Jackpot
- Draw Machine
- Next Draw Date

## Output Format:
Structure your response as follows:
[LOTTERY TYPE] RESULTS FOR DRAW ID [NUMBER]
Draw Date: [DATE]
WINNING NUMBERS
Main Numbers: [list numbers with + bonus]
Numerical Order: [sorted numbers with + bonus]
PRIZE DIVISIONS
DivisionWinnersPrize AmountDIV 1[number]R[amount]DIV 2[number]R[amount][continue for all divisions]
MORE INFO (if available)

Rollover Amount: R[amount]
Rollover No: [number]
[include all available fields]


## Common Pitfalls to Avoid:
1. **Row Shifting**: Do not move winner numbers from one row to another. Each division's winner count must come from its own row.
2. **Missing Data**: If a value shows as "-" or is blank, report it as such rather than using 0.
3. **Column Confusion**: Ensure you're reading from the correct column - WINNERS is typically the middle column, WINNINGS is the right column.

## Verification Steps:
1. After extracting DIV 1-3, double-check that you haven't shifted any values up or down.
2. Use the alternating row colors to verify you're on the correct line.
3. If DIV 1 and DIV 2 both show 0 winners with R0.00 prizes, this is often correct for jackpot games.
