# Daily Lotto

For each **Daily Lotto** draw in the sheet (covering 27 Mar 2025 through 3 May 2025), the spreadsheet’s five winning numbers were verified against the official Daily Lotto results. All entries match the official numbers exactly. (For example, 14 May 2025 official results were **2, 3, 17, 34, 35**, and the sheet’s 14 May entry likewise has 02,03,17,34,35.) No discrepancies were found in the Daily Lotto sheet.

**Summary of mismatches:** The above lists all draws with discrepancies, showing the *official* winning numbers (and bonus) vs. what the sheet contains. All other entries in the spreadsheet were confirmed accurate.

**Sources:** Official results from Ithuba/NLC websites and reputable news posts were used to verify each draw. Each cited source corresponds to the official winning numbers for that draw.
