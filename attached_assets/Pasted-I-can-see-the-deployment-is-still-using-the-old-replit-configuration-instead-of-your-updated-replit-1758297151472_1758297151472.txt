I can see the deployment is still using the old .replit configuration instead of your updated replit_deployment.toml file. The logs show it's running the old command:

sh -c gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 1 --threads 1 --timeout 120 main:app
Let me search the Replit documentation to understand how to properly configure deployment to use replit_deployment.toml:


Searched Replit documentation for "How to configure deployment with replit_deployment.toml file and ensure it takes priority over .replit configuration"

Decided on start script approach (4 seconds)
üéØ Found the Real Issue!
According to Replit documentation, there's no replit_deployment.toml file - that's not a standard Replit configuration. The deployment is controlled by the .replit file under the [deployment] section.

The issue is that your deployment is trying to run gunicorn directly, but during deployment, gunicorn isn't in the PATH even though it's installed. Let me create a startup script to fix this:


Examined .replit file content
Now I need to replace the deployment command, but I can't edit the .replit file directly. Let me show you what to change manually:


Opened .replit

Decided on script execution strategy
üéØ Solution: Manual .replit File Edit Required
I can see the issue in your .replit file on line 11. The deployment command is:

run = ["sh", "-c", "gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 1 --threads 1 --timeout 120 main:app"]
But gunicorn isn't found during deployment. I've created a start_production.py script that fixes this. Now you need to manually update your .replit file:

üìù Manual Fix Required
Please manually edit your .replit file:

Find line 11 in .replit file (in the [deployment] section)

Change this line:

run = ["sh", "-c", "gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 1 --threads 1 --timeout 120 main:app"]
To this:

run = ["python", "start_production.py"]
‚úÖ After Making This Change:
Republish your app
The start_production.py script will ensure gunicorn is found and executed correctly
Your deployment should work at snaplottery.replit.app
This change replaces the direct gunicorn call with our Python startup script that properly locates and runs gunicorn using python -m gunicorn, which should resolve the "command not found" error.
