                        <p class="lead">The South African National Lottery Lotto is the country's most popular lottery game, drawing millions of players every week with its massive jackpots and easy-to-understand format.</p>

            <h2 id="step1" class="mt-5">Step 1: Select Six Numbers</h2>
            <div class="step-content">
                <p>To play the South African Lotto, you need to select six numbers from a pool of 1 to 52. You can choose your numbers in two ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Manual Selection:</strong> Pick your own six lucky numbers based on whatever method you prefer - birthdays, anniversary dates, lucky numbers, or any numbers that feel significant to you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Quick Pick:</strong> Let the lottery terminal randomly select six numbers for you. Many jackpot winners have won using Quick Pick selections.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="tip-box my-3 p-3 bg-light border-start border-primary border-4">
                    <h5>Pro Tip:</h5>
                    <p class="mb-0">While many players use birthdays (numbers 1-31), including some higher numbers (32-52) in your selection can help ensure that if you win, you're less likely to share the jackpot with others who used similar number patterns.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2 id="step2" class="mt-5">Step 2: Choose Additional Boards</h2>
            <div class="step-content">
                <p>You can play multiple boards on a single ticket to increase your chances of winning. Each board costs R5.00 and allows you to select another set of six numbers. Most retailers offer tickets with up to 10 boards, but online platforms may offer more options.</p>
                <p>Playing multiple boards is a popular strategy because:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It increases your chances of matching winning numbers</li>
                    <li>You can try different number combinations in a single draw</li>
                    <li>It's more convenient than buying multiple single tickets</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2 id="step3" class="mt-5">Step 3: Select LOTTO PLUS Options</h2>
            <div class="step-content">
                <p>For additional chances to win, you can add LOTTO PLUS 1 and LOTTO PLUS 2 to your ticket. These are supplementary draws using the same numbers you selected for the main Lotto draw.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>LOTTO PLUS 1:</strong> Costs an additional R2.50 per board</li>
                    <li><strong>LOTTO PLUS 2:</strong> Costs an additional R2.50 per board</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you choose to play all three games (Lotto, LOTTO PLUS 1, and LOTTO PLUS 2), the total cost per board would be R10.00 (R5.00 + R2.50 + R2.50).</p>
                <div class="alert alert-info">
                    <strong>Important:</strong> You cannot play LOTTO PLUS 1 or LOTTO PLUS 2 without first playing the main Lotto game. Additionally, to play LOTTO PLUS 2, you must also play LOTTO PLUS 1.
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2 id="step4" class="mt-5">Step 4: Purchase Your Ticket</h2>
            <div class="step-content">
                <p>Once you've decided on your numbers and which games to play, you can purchase your ticket through several channels:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Retail Outlets:</strong> Visit any authorized National Lottery retailer across South Africa. These include supermarkets, petrol stations, and dedicated lottery kiosks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Online:</strong> Purchase tickets through the official National Lottery website or mobile app.</li>
                    <li><strong>Banking Apps:</strong> Some South African banks allow lottery ticket purchases through their banking apps.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Make sure to keep your ticket safe - you'll need it to claim any prizes.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 id="step5" class="mt-5">Step 5: Watch the Draw</h2>
            <div class="step-content">
                <p>Lotto draws are conducted twice weekly:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Wednesdays:</strong> 20:56 on SABC 2</li>
                    <li><strong>Saturdays:</strong> 20:56 on SABC 2</li>
                </ul>
                <p>During each draw, six main numbers and one bonus ball are randomly selected. The LOTTO PLUS 1 and LOTTO PLUS 2 draws follow immediately after the main Lotto draw.</p>
                <div class="tip-box my-3 p-3 bg-light border-start border-primary border-4">
                    <h5>Did You Know?</h5>
                    <p class="mb-0">The bonus ball is not selected separately - it's the 7th ball drawn during the regular drawing process. It only comes into play for the second prize division.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="step-content">
                <p>After the draw, check your ticket to see if you've won by comparing your numbers with the drawn numbers. You can:</p>
