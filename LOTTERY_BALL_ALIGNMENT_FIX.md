# Lottery Ball Alignment Fix for Mobile Devices

## Issues Identified

The mobile view of the Snap Lotto application was experiencing several display issues with lottery balls:

1. **Ball Overlap**: Lottery balls were overlapping each other on mobile screens, making the numbers difficult to read.
2. **Edge Cutoff**: Some lottery balls were extending beyond the screen edge, causing them to be partially visible or completely cut off.
3. **Spacing Issues**: The spacing between lottery balls wasn't properly adjusted for smaller screens.
4. **Responsiveness**: The lottery ball sizes weren't adapting correctly to different mobile screen sizes.

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Responsive Lottery Ball Sizing

Added media queries to adjust the size and spacing of lottery balls based on screen width:

```css
/* Default size (desktop) */
.lottery-ball {
    width: 50px;
    height: 50px;
    /* Other properties */
}

/* Tablet and small screens */
@media (max-width: 576px) {
    .lottery-ball {
        width: 40px;
        height: 40px;
        font-size: 0.9rem;
        margin: 0 4px 8px 0;
    }
}

/* Phone and very small screens */
@media (max-width: 360px) {
    .lottery-ball {
        width: 34px;
        height: 34px;
        font-size: 0.85rem;
        margin: 0 3px 6px 0;
    }
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Container Layout

Modified the container layout to properly handle lottery balls on small screens:

```css
/* Desktop layout */
.numbers-container {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: flex-start;
}

/* Mobile layout adjustment */
@media (max-width: 576px) {
    .numbers-container {
        justify-content: center;
    }
}
```

### 3. Optimized Ball Containers

Adjusted the lottery ball containers to ensure proper spacing:

```css
.lottery-ball-container {
    width: 26px;
    text-align: center;
    display: inline-block;
    margin: 0 2px 4px;
}

@media (max-width: 576px) {
    .lottery-ball-container {
        width: 23px;
        margin: 0 1px 3px;
    }
}

@media (max-width: 400px) {
    .lottery-ball-container {
        width: 20px;
        margin: 0 1px 2px;
    }
}
```

### 4. Row Display in Ticket Scanner

Fixed the ticket scanner page to ensure proper row display of lottery balls:

```css
#ticket-numbers .mb-3 {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    align-items: center;
    margin-bottom: 1rem !important;
}

@media (max-width: 576px) {
    #ticket-numbers .mb-3 {
        justify-content: flex-start;
    }
    
    #ticket-numbers .mb-3 .mx-2 {
        margin-left: 0.25rem !important;
        margin-right: 0.25rem !important;
    }
}
```

### 5. Adaptive Bonus Ball Indicator

Scaled down the bonus ball indicator for smaller screens:

```css
@media (max-width: 576px) {
    .lottery-ball-bonus::after {
        width: 8px;
        height: 8px;
        top: -2px;
        right: -2px;
    }
}

@media (max-width: 400px) {
    .lottery-ball-bonus::after {
        width: 6px;
        height: 6px;
        top: -1px;
        right: -1px;
    }
}
```

## Results

- Lottery balls now display properly on mobile devices without overlapping
- All lottery balls remain within the screen boundaries
- Bonus ball indicators are properly sized for mobile views
- Layout is consistent across different mobile screen sizes
- Numbers are clearly visible even on small screens

## Future Improvements

1. **Further Optimization**: Consider additional optimizations for extremely small screens or landscape orientation
2. **Touch Target Sizing**: Ensure all interactive elements maintain proper touch target sizes for mobile use
3. **Testing Framework**: Implement automated testing for mobile layouts to prevent regression in future updates
