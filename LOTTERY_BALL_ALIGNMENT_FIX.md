# Lottery Ball Alignment Fix

## Issue Description
The lottery ball display on various pages had alignment issues, particularly with the numbers inside the balls. The numbers were not properly centered within the circular lottery balls, causing an unprofessional appearance and potentially confusing display of results.

## Root Cause Analysis
After investigating the CSS styling for lottery balls, we found that:

1. The text inside the lottery balls was not properly centered, both horizontally and vertically
2. The positioning was using relative values that didn't account for different ball sizes
3. The lottery ball styling lacked proper content alignment properties

## Solution Implemented
We updated the CSS for lottery balls in `static/css/lottery.css` to use absolute positioning with transform properties for precise centering:

```css
.lottery-ball {
    position: relative;
    display: inline-block;
    width: 40px;
    height: 40px;
    border-radius: 50%;
    margin: 0 3px;
    background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #ffeb3b, #ffc107);
    box-shadow: 0 3px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
    text-align: center;
}

.lottery-ball .number {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    font-weight: bold;
    font-size: 18px;
    color: #000;
}
```

The key improvements were:
1. Using `position: absolute` for the number element
2. Setting `top: 50%` and `left: 50%` to position from the center
3. Using `transform: translate(-50%, -50%)` to achieve true centering
4. Standardizing font size and weight for consistent appearance

## Additional Improvements
For bonus balls (like in Powerball games), we maintained the distinct styling while ensuring proper alignment:

```css
.bonus-ball {
    background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #fff176, #ffd54f);
    border: 2px solid #ffa000;
}
```

## Verification
The updated CSS ensures that:
- Numbers are perfectly centered within lottery balls
- Alignment is consistent across different screen sizes and devices
- Bonus balls maintain their distinct appearance while having proper number alignment
- The display looks professional and matches the design seen on official lottery websites

## Technical Notes
- Using absolute positioning with transform is the most reliable method for centering content within circular elements
- This approach works consistently across modern browsers
- The gradient background maintains the 3D effect while allowing for clear text visibility
